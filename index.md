# Executive Summary
For the final projeet our team is building a web application that will help the pharmacy owners to manage their stocks for the medicines and and keep the reord of their medicine sales.For the project I am working on the back end working with fusion chart and the php  components and making the charts dynamic and resposive.


# Project Report 95%

##### The problem column acts as a primary key in one table and foreign key in the other and serves as a connection between them.

## Things that well
#### 1.Database Design and Implementaion
#### 2.Database visualisation using fusion charts.

## Things that didnt went well/minor issues

#### 1.The visualisation of different suggested medicines according to the specific health problem type.
#### 2.Creation of tables inside a user database when the user signup.

## Interesting Things
The fusion charts map feature can be used to show and which medicines are trending in different regions of the world.We tried it
using our local database.It was working somewhat fine but the data needs to be legit.We might add this feature if the project finishes before the planned deadline but for now its going somewhat behind the schedule so we might not add that.


# NEXT WEEK TO DO'S

#### Making the new decided features up and working.
#### Debug the glitches and errors(regarding the database).
#### The data from mysql is shown in front end(a bug which messes the responsiveness of the page).

# Backlog

#### making the features of the project ready

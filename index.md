##### The problem column acts as a primary key in one table and foreign key in the other and serves as a connection between them.

## Things that well
#### 1.The feature is working fine and the values changes according to the option.


## Things that didnt went well/minor issues

#### 1.Having some issues with the responsiveness of the charts.
#### 2.For showing similar results I wanted to visualise using charts but its giving issues on the server side.

## Interesting Things
Fusion charts has an interestign feature which allows us to use a chart and upon click a charts specific component it will refer to another chart.Its a very interesting feature and will be useful when the data is large and need to be combined according to the types.

## Next Week to Do's

#### 1.Making the charts resposive
#### 2.CSS Styling
#### 3.Integrating the landing page.  

## Backlog
